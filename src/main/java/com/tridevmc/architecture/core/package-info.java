/**
 * This package contains the core interfaces and classes for ArchitectureCraft.
 * <p>
 * The main differentiator between this and the common/client packages is that the code within
 * is not directly dependent on Minecraft or Forge.
 * <p>
 * There may be helper methods that provide ways to convert our internal data structures
 * to Minecraft/Forge classes, but the core logic should be independent of Minecraft/Forge.
